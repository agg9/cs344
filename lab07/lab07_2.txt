7.2
Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
 - Categorical data is data that is textual, while numerical data is data that is a number, and any value that would be
    treated as a number.
Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
    Task 1.)  train_model(
                learning_rate=0.00003,
                steps=1000,
                batch_size=5
                )

    Final RSME: 175.66


    Task 2.) adding population input with the same hyper-parameters as task 1 does not yeild better output.
    train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00003,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="population"
)

    Final RSME: 178.20

What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them?
    -The learning rate, number of training steps, and batch size.  There is no standard tuning algorithm.
