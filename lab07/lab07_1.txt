 1. cities['city saint and greater than 50 miles'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: val.startswith('San')
 2. cities.reindex([4,2,5,1]).  Index values on in original DataFrame's are allowed because indexes are often strings pulled
        from the data.
Why would one use Pandas rather than the standard data manipulation features provided by NumPy?
    - Pandas has high level data manipulation tools, and is built on top of NumPy, so it has the capabilities
        to do much more, but also can be a lot easier.
Under what circumstances would it be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame?
    -It would be useful to shuffle to eliminate bias in the data.
