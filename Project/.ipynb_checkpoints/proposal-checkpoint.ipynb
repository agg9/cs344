    "My project proposal is to build a neural network that will predict a baseball players performance in an upcoming game.  While a players performance may be very difficult to predict at a high percentage, I'm hoping I might have some success.  I will be using an API to retrieve data for past and upcoming games, and will be building a neural network using Keras.  "

    "Background:  I am settling on using a dnnregressor with tensorflow to train the model, but have experimented with several different technologies such as a linearregressors and neural networks using keras.  I also experimented with sklearn, as many of the examples I found online of sports predictions used those.  However, I decided to use tensorflow since we used that in class, and wanted to expand upon what I've learned."

    "Implementation:  It all begins with the data. I am getting my data from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ .  It has several different datasets that will be useful for this project.  I combined different tables to create a dataset which included many different statistics over a players career, including stats and awards.  From there, I used tensorflow to train the data. The implementation was based on the california_housing nerual network we used in class."
