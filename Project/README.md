Baseball Fantasy Predictions

This project aims to predict the fantasy value of a baseball player through the use of a nerual network.

The file baseball_predicitions.py is the only file needed to run the code.  However first, you need to get the proper datasets.
The data can be found here http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ .
Download the comma-delimited version, and save the Batting.csv and People.csv in the same location as the python file.
From there, the file should be able to run.
