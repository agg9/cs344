    "### Vision:\n",
    "This project was indended to predict a baseball players performance using a nueral network and other statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational approaches to analyzing sports data, including baseball, is not something new.  Especially in the world of fantasy sports, data analytics is very popular, and almost needed. I have also often found the information I find that ranks baseball players going into a season not very reliable.  This project will aim to address that specific problem, and hopefully provide a more accurate approach to predict players performance, specific based on fantasy value.  Instead of taking an analytical approach, I decided to build a neural network.  My hopes is that the network would possible find some correlation between a players previous season, and how they perform the next. "

    "### Background:\n",
    "The system was built with Tensorflow, using its DNNRegressor.  I chose this because I wanted to use a tool we learned in class, and expand on it.  I specifically chose to use Tensorflow because the examples we learned in class used datasets to make predictions, which is what my goal for this project was.  The system also uses NumPy and Pandas for the data manipulation, sklearn to calculate the performance or metrics, and matplotlib to display any graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the process of building this network, I also tried a few different technologies.  The first, was again using Tensorfow, but using the linearregressor instead.  While this wasn't a bad option, i didnt spend much time with it, as I had more interest a deep learning sytle of approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I tried to build a model using Keras.  I experimented with this for awhile, after finding an example of someone who built a network to predict a players basketball prediction.  However, the example wasn't very in depth, and had a lot of outdated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what led me to stick with Tensorflow's DNNRegressor.  I wasn't based this work off of anything, but was going into it kind of blind.  While I had very ambitious plans, I quickly learned there was a reason I didn't find examples for this idea.\n",

    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is implemented in Python.  First, I installed Pycharm on my desktop at home, and got an environment running on windows using Anaconda.  As someone who likes working in the lab, this made it a lot easier to work, especially when you have to sit 10 - 15 minutes while a model was training.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I began working on the dataset.  I had the skeleton of the model already layed out for me, since I was basing my work on Google's DNNRegressor example.  I initially used Beautiful Soup to web scrape the data I wanted after find a good tutorial on codecademy.  However, I ended up just using a dataset on found from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ .\n",
    "It has batting and pitching stats from 1871 - 2018.  It had a ton of good data, and was easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there I began building my training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
    "I used data up to 2017 to build the training and validation, and used only 2018 for the testing.  The target feature was fantasy value, which is simply the amount of fantasy points a player would have scoring over the course of the season.  While different fantasy leagues may have different rules, the scoring system I based this one is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitters\n",
    "Single = 1\n",
    "Double = 2\n",
    "Triple = 3\n",
    "Home Run = 4\n",
    "Run = 1\n",
    "RBI = 1\n",
    "Walk = 1\n",
    "Stolen Base = 2\n",
    "Hit By Pitch = 1\n",
    "Strike Out = -.5\n",
    "Caught Stealing = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting the datasets right, I changed the model to have the right features and targets for my project.  From there I began testing.  I quickly noticed the predictions were not deviating far.  This was because the target value was built using the selected features.  So, I made some changes into the testing set.  I added a column that had the fantasy value of a player next season.  Here, the model would train using data from a players previous season, and the target value would be based on his next season.  I hoped that this would find some correlation between on players performance over different years, and also give me more deviation.\n"

    "### Results:\n",
    "Here were the RSME values on the different datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "RSME (on training data): 113.03\n",
    "RSME (on validation data): 110.41\n",
    "Final RMSE: 55.09\n",
    "\n",
    "Right away I noticed that the Final RMSE on the testing data was way lower than the training / validation.  This is because the testing dataset is very small compared to the other.  Because of the way the model is set up, the predictions are made using data from one year, while it is training on way more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the actual predictions, the predictions had a decent deviation, with some players making big jumps.  I decided to show the top 10 players of 2018, for reference.  Then I wanted to compare the predictions will how players are actually performing so far in 2019.  I ran the model a few different times, and took the best set of results.  If it took the predictions against who the top 20 players are at this exact moment in the mlb, the model would have predicted\n",
    "7/20  which isn't terrible, but not great.  The only ones that were predicted right were players that did well in the previous year.  The model doesn't really have any surprising predictions.  However, predicting the performance of a player's overall season, or making sports predictions in general is just a hard thing to do.  If it were easy, I think a lot more people would be doing it.  With that being said, I think there are some changes that could improve this.  For example, it doesn't take into account players changing teams, which could have a big impact on their batting statistics. \n",

    "### Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "While this system doesn't provide the most accurate predictions, something like this could be very useful for those into fantasy sports.  If a model was able to predict at a high percent, a system could provide an edge for people during fantasy drafts.  On a bigger scale, baseball organizations themselves would benefit from it.  Being able to predict how players will perform, would be essential to front office decisions, as well as game-time decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if this were the case, it would also have some ethical implications.  For one, gamblers around the world would be interested in it.  Having any accurate prediction in the sports world is something that can make money.  Not only would gamblers want to use such a system, but Casinos as well. "
