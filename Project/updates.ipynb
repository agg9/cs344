    "## Updates.
     The first update made was in the dataset itself.  Since the walkthrough, I added a column in the dataset that
    has a players fantasy value for their next season.  This column only works for past season though.  This was used as the
    new target value, in hopes the network could find a link between a players past season data, and their next years
    performance.
    
    The second update was that the output now has more information.  Before, the output only had a list of the top fantasy
    values, but nothing out.  Now it has player information as well.  This is important to being able to handle and use
    output properly.
    
    Finally, I added to the different areas needed for the final report."
