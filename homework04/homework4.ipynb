    "1. I think the \"deep\" neural networks will not be a bust, but be something that is continued to use for years.  While predicting the future of tech is a very hard thing to do, deep learning has done things in recent years that no one would have thought possible, and continues to progress at a rapid pace.  Take AlphaGo for example; the AI was able to beat the world champion in the game of GO. Self-driving cars are anothing example of what neural networks have achieved.\n",
    "    While past achievements don't necessarily point to more breakthroughs, there is still examples that point to some.  The Google DeepLearning has recently built something that can identify new images, without needed 1000s of training images or examples.  As neural networks have been known to need big data to train and work properly, this shows new possibilities.  While this may need a lot more work, deep learning has proved to consistenly make new breakthroughs and advances.  Between that, and the achievements deep learning as given, I think that it will continue to play a big role in AI in years to come.    "
