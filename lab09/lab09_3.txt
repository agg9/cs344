a.Exercise 1:
Whatâ€™s the size of the cats/dogs datasets?
-dogs training set: 1000
-cats training set: 1000
-dogs validation set: 500
-cats validation set: 500
How does the first convnet compare with the one we did in class.
- The convnet is very similar to the one we did in class.  It has 3 layers, and uses max-pooling.  The
    initial input shape is much larger though with 150x150.

Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?
-One interesting pattern is that for both cats and dogs, the network pays a lot of attention to the face, especially
     the ears of the animal.

b.Exercise 2:
What is data augmentation?
-Data augmentation is a way to "augment" training examples by doing random transformations.  This is important
    so that the model doesn't see the exact same picture twice, which helps prevent overfitting and helps the model
    generalize better.

Report your best results and the hyperparameters you used to get them.
results:
    loss: .535
    acc:  .734
    val_loss: .4907
    val_acc:  .767


hyperparameters:
history = model.fit_generator(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=150,
      epochs=30,
      validation_data=validation_generator,
      validation_steps=80,
      verbose=2)
