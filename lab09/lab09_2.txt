a.Why are we regularizing with respect to sparsity?
    Regularizing with respect to sparsity helps the model be optimized more effectively, therefore making the model
    become more efficient.

b.How does L1 regularization increase sparsity?
    L1 regularization increases sparsity because it encourages weights to be exactly zero.  The L1 loss minimizes
    the sum of absolute differences between values by using this zero weight.  This in turn produces many coefficients with
    0 values, and only a small number of with large values, which is what makes the model more sparse.

c.Task 1: Here, just report the best log loss value / model size you can get and what gamma value you used to get them.
    Loss loss value: .24
    Model size: 752

    gamma value: 0.2
