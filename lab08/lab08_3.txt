a.Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
    Both of these tools are libraries that can be used for data visualization.  Seaborn however is built on top of
    MatPlotLib, and allows for different variations and plot types.
b.How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
    The dataset is 397 x 8.  Yes, it seems appropriate as the problem isn't too complex, but a prediction of fuel efficiency.
c.Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
    Prescribed normalization makes training easier by using different scales and ranges.
d.Is this an example of a linear regression model?
    Yes.
e.In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
    I agree.  As we discussed in class, a network that is too big can end up just 'memorizing' inputs, instead of
        actually learning.  So I think in the case of a smaller dataset, a smaller network fits better.
