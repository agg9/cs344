Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
	- It shows which classes that were misclassified as others. This is because digits would get confused for eachother.  It seems as though 5 and 9 are often misclassified in this example.

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.
	The main difference is that TensorFlow uses a DNNClassifier object that accepts different parameters such as the hidden units, feature columns and optimzer, where we built those steps seperately with
	Keras.  This also means that the TensorFlow architecture is not a CNN.

Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
	-With 10 steps the visualizaitons are digital looking.  They don't really looking like anything just
	different colored pixels.  With the 1000 steps however, the visualizations are much more refined, and often images are able to be made out.
