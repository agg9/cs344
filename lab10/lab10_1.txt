10.1
Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
    I would rather use Keras.  Keras seems to be much more user-friendly and easier to understand, which makes it easier
    for me to build models.  Also, I am still able to integrate TF code into Keras, so I am not really missing anything
    by using Keras.

Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.
    hyper-parameters:
    dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
        learning_rate=0.001,
        steps=5000,
        batch_size=200,
        hidden_units=[10, 10, 5],
        training_examples=training_examples,
        training_targets=training_targets,
        validation_examples=validation_examples,
        validation_targets=validation_targets)

        Final RSME (training data): 97.56
        Final RSME (validation data): 98.71
